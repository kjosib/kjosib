## Hi there üëã

We who are about to code, salute you!


### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...

When I'm not sailing a sea of cubicles, pursuing the hedonic delights of representing my neighborhood to the home owners association, or trying to get my child to see the wisdom of outerwear, I can sometimes be found hacking away at a project inspired by unquenchable
**curiosity about the deeper mysteries** of -- not just computer science per se, but of
how we as *programming animals* relate to and work with those towering edifices of applied
mathematics we like to call code-bases. That and an old academic catalog are pretty much responsible for the "booze-tools" module (which was named as an oblique pun on "Java").

I currently work for a large bank in the corporate investing line of business.
Officially, I manage some junior programmers and spend the rest of the time on "software engineering", such as it is.
I also run a local-office knowledge-sharing community and loudly advocate for developer quality-of-life,
which connects intimately with all the things our employers and clients care about.

I am inordinately interested in programming languages. My current focus during free time is Sophie.
Previous long-running projects have inspired some of the more domain-specific things you see below.

I have not always been officially on the books as a programmer everywhere I've worked,
but virtually everywhere I fall into designing, build, and support information systems.

For example, some time in a project-controls role *(think costs, budgets, schedules, and detailed forecasts all under change management and compared against historical norms)*
inspired me to explore *matrix-oriented programming* and *declarative hierarchical report formatting*.
