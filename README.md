## Hi there 👋

We who are about to code, salute you!


### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

When I'm not sailing a sea of cubicles, pursuing the hedonic delights of representing my neighborhood to the home owners association, or trying to get my child to see the wisdom of outerwear, I can sometimes be found hacking away at a project inspired by unquenchable
**curiosity about the deeper mysteries** of -- not just computer science per se, but of
how we as *programming animals* relate to and work with those towering edifices of applied
mathematics we like to call code-bases. That and an old academic catalog are pretty much responsible for the "booze-tools" module (which was named as an oblique pun on "Java").

Although I don't currently work for a tech company, I still get paid (at least in part)
to design, build, and support information systems. At the moment, it's all about project controls: think costs, budgets, schedules, and detailed forecasts all under change management and compared against historical norms. That's why I've been inspired
to explore *matrix-oriented programming* and *declarative hierarchical report formatting*.


### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

* **The Science of Well-Being** on Coursera.
* More than I ever cared to learn about MS-Access and VBA.
