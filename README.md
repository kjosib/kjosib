## Hi there üëã

We who are about to code, salute you!

To pay the bills, I work full time. I get to spend some of that time making information
systems that save time and improve the consistency of the company's project controls
deliverables. The rest of the time, I eat my own dog-food. That's why I've been inspired
to explore *matrix-oriented programming* and *declarative hierarchical report formatting*.

When I'm not sailing a sea of cubicles, pursuing the hedonic delights of representing my neighborhood to the home owners association, or trying to get my child to see the wisdom of outerwear, I can sometimes be found hacking away at a project inspired by unquenchable
**curiosity about the deeper mysteries** of -- not just computer science per se, but of
how we as *programming animals* relate to and work with those towering edifices of applied
mathematics we like to call code-bases. That and an old academic catalog are pretty much responsible for the "booze-tools" module (which was named as an oblique pun on "Java").

* More than I ever cared to learn about MS-Access and VBA.

### ‚ú® Let's blow up the universe (three ways) ...

Normally, text files contain programming code.
At the level of a single function definition,
a stream of text is probably a fine way to interact, but in the larger view
there's all this rich
interconnected semantic structure which logically ought to
exist as a proper database with a public query API.

So how do you do (branching, merging) version control on a database?
It's not so simple as it sounds.
More generally, there are other applications beyond program code
for wanting a (branching, merging) graph database.

Assuming you get your code into a database, you've got a problem to get
all the other nice features of a modern IDE working, and another problem to deal with
language translators expecting to have to recover the structure from plain text.

I don't have an easy answer, but it does vaguely remind me of
the hypertext segment in
Doug Engelbart's
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos .
